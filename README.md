# XLSForm Server

This repo lets developers setup an XLSForm server for testing. 

This server will appear like any other machine on your network. This allows you to connect external devices to test the server. We assume your network hands out IP addresses over DHCP. You can change this behavior in `Vagrantfile`.

Please don't use this server in production. It is not configured to be robust or safe.
